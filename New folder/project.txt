Dear to whom it may concern, 
	My name is Andres Garcia I been a job trainer for many years, and right now I'm the team trainer at wholefoods market. I had the 
honor of wokring with Tiffany Guerrero as her team trainer. We work in the fish department, and in my expeience a very diffcult deparment
to work: there alot of food safety rules, safety rules, and custumer service is always difficult. Tiffany is one of my best trainee I ever had, she 
a fast leaner, has a go to attudie, and always excited to learn something new. 
	She was working another department, but when we needed help Tiffany was always happy to pick up a shift and get to work. I 
started showing her how the seafoo Evd department is run, what do we expect from her, and how to pay attention to little details. Every day
we work I showed her how to make the fish presentable, how to trim and clean without causing injury, and how to take to custusmers. She 
always asking how does did look or how can we work this, she has a disire to improve. Every day we work I noticed how she was taking my 
advice and applying to everything. When I explain why is something dangrous and how we can easy prevent she pass on it on the other coworkers.
	I remember their was a difficult custumer, he was very nick picky and it looked like he was having a hard day. Tiffany reconmended what's
easy to cook, what goes with it and even listen to the guy how his probems when the guy left he was very happy. Now anytime he comes by he makes 
his way to seafood just to say hi, half the time he doesnt buy any fish, he just wanted to say hi.Tiffany is a smart, hard working, strong young lady and 
she would be a amazing addition to any team. She always learning, improving, and I believe she will do amazing with anything you need from her. If you
have any question please contact me at andres.garcia1@wholefoods.com. Thank you for your time.
