                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Andres Garcia but I perfer to be call Andy. I am 28 years old; I love to cook,
                    watch anime, read books, and messing around with code. My goal is to learn everything I can to
                    become a full stack webdevelper.I remember back in highschool I used to spent time after school
                    making horrible games that didnt even work most of the times. Adobe flash was a nightmare to work
                    with...most of the times, but after hours of messing around, adding and deleting line of code over
                    and over again. I eventually got something working and I was able to move a stick figure around.
                    Seeing everyone enjoy what I made definitely gave me a sense of joy/pride. I continue trying to make
                    games. <br>
                    After highschool I went to college but unfortunately it did not work out. I started working
                    in the meat and seafood department after college for 2 major retail company and I fell in love with
                    it.
                    Transforming a big piece of meat or a huge wholefish and transforming into beautiful steaks or
                    amazing
                    fillets. I worked my way up to managment, assistance manager to be exact. I got the opportunity to
                    learn
                    kinfes skills, communcation skills, and managment skills, but I lost a sense of happyiness. One day
                    I was
                    on lunch, and I stumble on a video explaining how to make your own name generator. From there I
                    clicked
                    another video, than another, and another and that's when I decided to find a new career.I did some
                    research
                    and found the UCLA Coding Bootcamp.Now I'm learning alot and I can't wait to be a fullstack
                    webdevelper.
